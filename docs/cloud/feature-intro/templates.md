## Creating and Using Templates

The template feature allows you to save your own canvases as templates for repeated use of specific functions by yourself or others.

You can convert the current canvas into a template using the "Share" button in the canvas. The converted template will be saved in "My Templates".

If you wish to share a template with other users, you can submit the template for review. After approval, your template will be displayed in "All Templates" for other users to use.
